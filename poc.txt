Demonstrate Need
Describe the problem you’re trying to solve or the reason your product needs to exist. 

Independent convenience stores and small chains lack access to modern tools and systems that enable automated rebate and promotions tracking, item-level sales analytics, and operational efficiency—resulting in missed revenue, margin loss, and exclusion from manufacturer-funded promotions.

In other words, they are:
Excluded from enterprise-grade tools available to larger chains.
Unable to access or manage rebate programs due to lack of data and time.
Losing money on rebates and promotions they could be eligible for.
Trapped by outdated & siloed systems (manual processes, POS reports, paper invoices).
Not supported by wholesalers or manufacturers with timely, detailed data.

Evision Solution
Use customer feedback to brainstorm solutions. Assess your ideas based on constraints (i.e. time, cost, tech) in order to identify feasible solutions.

PART 1: POC Sales Analysis
Extract & Store: We need a solution to extract sales data from TLogs and pull them into a centralized cloud database.  <ED diagram>

Clean: the data needs to match each transaction via the C4C Pricebook in order to structure the data using the UPC code. <need pricebook>

Consolidate & Store: the data for each independent or small chain owner needs to be consolidated and visible through a client facing dashboard. <dashboard>

Report: each store owner is able to run reports based on their store sales data.

Reports TBC
Purpose
1
Item-Level Sales Report
Tracks units and revenue by SKU, helping identify best/worst sellers, set pricing, and drive rebate eligibility.
2
Top-Selling Items
Quickly shows what products drive most sales or margin — useful for merchandising and reorder priorities.
3
Slow-Moving / Dead Inventory Report
Flags SKUs with no or low sales over a period — helps reduce overstock and free up shelf space.
4
Rebate-Eligible Item Report
Lists SKUs tied to manufacturer programs and their sales volume — helps maximize rebate submission and earnings.
5
Promotion Performance Report
Shows how in-store promos affected sales volume or mix — informs future offers or CPG negotiation.
6
Category Sales Breakdown
Slices sales by department (e.g. tobacco, beverages, snacks) — helps optimize category placement & margins.
7
Hourly/Daily Sales by Product
Useful for labor planning and promo timing (e.g., energy drink spikes in morning vs. candy sales in afternoon).
8
Store Comparison Report (if multiple stores)
Lets owners benchmark locations — see which store is underperforming by SKU or category.
9
Sales vs. Delivery Report
Helps reconcile delivery invoices with POS sell-through — flags possible shrink, overstocking, or theft.
10
Voids / Refunds / No Sales
Audit-focused report to detect suspicious register activity — useful for loss prevention.
11
Cashier/Employee Sales Summary
Measures individual cashier sales and refund volume — identifies upsell potential or fraud.
12
Margin by SKU /Category
Helps spot high-volume, low-margin items (profit killers)
13
Basket Size & Mix Report
Tracks average sale per customer and which items are often bought together — helps bundle or upsell.
14
Missed Rebate Opportunities Report
Shows SKUs you sold but didn’t submit for rebate (or weren’t eligible due to purchase source) — often $300–$1,500/month missed.
15
AI Supported Analysis & Responses
Ability for operators to ask natural-language Qs like:
What items are selling best during morning rush?
When is my morning rush time slot?
What products are down this week in Store 2?
Which SKUs pair best with energy drinks?
